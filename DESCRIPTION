Description: A set of functions and datasets implementation of small area estimation when auxiliary variable is measured with error. These functions provide a empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator and mean squared error (MSE) estimator of the EBLUP. These models were developed by Ybarra and Lohr (2008) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asn048>.
